## How to Submit apps?
Simply post a message under #software in the [Mac Gaming Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/kv9k7SvC8X) and I'll add the link and write a post to this site. Or if you're feeling nice, you could make the post for the software yourself using this template. When posting under #software, please follow the same format as all the other messages!
