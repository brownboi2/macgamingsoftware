##WineBottler - Bootcamp Alternatives
Description: Run Windows-based Programs on a Mac. This is not recommended as it does not work on M1/2 and not even on the recent Intel Macs (unless you downgrade MacOS). Even if you do downgrade it's still not recommended since it's very outdated, uses an old version of wine and also won't work with many games and applications.
